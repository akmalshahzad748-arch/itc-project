        <p class="tagline">Connecting Lives Through Blood Donation</p>
        <p>
            Blood Bridge is a platform created to connect blood donors with
            patients who are in urgent need of blood. Our goal is to make
            blood donation simple, fast, and accessible for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through Blood Bridge, donors can register themselves and help
            save lives, while patients and hospitals can easily find
            available blood donors in their area.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is designed as an educational and social initiative
            to spread awareness about the importance of blood donation.
